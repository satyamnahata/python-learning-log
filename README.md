# 🐍 Python Learning Log

Welcome to my personal Python learning repo!  
This space is where I document my journey from zero to giga-chad Python dev 🚀

## 🗂 Repo Structure

- `projects/` - Hands-on mini-projects I’ve built
- `notes/` - Core concepts, cheat sheets & things I learned
- `scripts/` - Small practice files, challenges, experiments

## 🧠 What I’ve Built So Far

### ✅ Completed Projects:
1. **Password Generator** 🔐  
   → Random password generator using letters, numbers & symbols. Customizable length.

2. **Tic Tac Toe Game** ❌⭕  
   → A 2-player console-based game. No bots yet, but it's clean.

## 🔮 What's Next?

I'll be building more beginner → intermediate level Python projects, learning libraries like:
- `pandas` (data wrangling)
- `matplotlib` (data viz)
- `flask` or `streamlit` (web apps maybe)
- And diving deeper into Pythonic thinking 🧬

## ⚙ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- VS Code (main editor)  
- Jupyter Notebooks (for pandas stuff)
